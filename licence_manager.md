# Licence Manager

Licence Manager window appears when there is no licence connected to the computer or the 30-day demo version is in use.

## 30-day Trial Version

> Starting the program for the first time, you will need an internet connection. After activation, it works offline, as well.

You don't need to register or log in to use the 30-day trial version. Licence Manager window will appear at every start to show us how many days have left.

## Paring a Licence

> Paring a Licence, you will need an internet connection. After activation, it works offline, as well.

Having purchased a licence, you should log in using the Licence Manager window by clicking on the **Log In** button. 

> If you are not a registered user or you don't have a licence, you should click on **Sign Up** button.

Logging in successfully, the program will automatically find the licence connected to the user. If there are more licences connected to the user, you can choose from a list which licence should be paired to the computer you use. Having completed the activation process, you will see Licence Manager window pop up again only in that case when some problem come up with your licence.
