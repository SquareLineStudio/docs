# Asset Panel

Images and fonts, added to the project, appear in the **Asset Panel**. Having created a project, an Asset folder has also been created. If you copy the images needed to your project there, the program will load them automatically listing them in the **Asset Panel**. Images are allowed in PNG and JPG format. If you double click on the image in the **Asset Panel**, it will be opened in the default image browser.

If you would like to add fonts to your project, you should copy them into the **Asset/Fonts** folder. Then the program will autoload them.

## Add files into assets

If you would like to add an image to the **Asset Panel**, there are two ways to do it. You can copy the image with a file manager program to the Asset folder or you can click on the *Add file into Assets* button and select the image you want to add, which then automatically gets among the assets.
