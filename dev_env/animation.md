# Animation Panel

You can create and manage custom animations in the Animation Panel. You can add several animation properties to each animation so as to make complex animations.

## Add new animation

Before creating a new animation, you should select a name to it. Then it will be added to the **Manage animation list** by clicking on the Add animation button.

## Manage animation

You can edit the selected animation in this section. You can create, edit or delete animation properties here.

### Select animation

You can choose an animation of yours from a drop-down menu. You can start the selected animation by clicking on the **Play** button on the prefered widget from the Default list. The animation can be deleted by clicking on the **Bin** button. In this case, it will be removed from all widgets it have been added to.

### Default object

- **Position  Y** - Shifting on the Y axis.
- **Width** - Setting the width of the widget.
