# How to upgrade SquareLine Studio to an up-to-date version?

You can refresh the program in [**Preferences**](https://docs.squareline.io/docs/squareline) menu. In **About** section, there is a **CHECK FOR UPGRADE** button. Clicking on it, the program will check if there is a newer version of the software. If there is one, you can click on **UPGRADE** button to open the Downloads menu on our webpage where you can download the newest version of the software.

Launching the installer, a pop up window will appear with the message of ""There is an older version of the software on your computer. Do you wish to overwrite it?"" By allowing it and finishing the installing process, an up-to-date version will be installed.
