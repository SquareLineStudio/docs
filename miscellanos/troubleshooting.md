# Troubleshooting

If you find any issues with SquareLine Studio check out the list below if there is already a solution for it. If not, please open a [Topic and the Forum](https://forum.squareline.io/). We will probably ask you to send us the logs. You can find them here:

- **Windows:** `C:\Users<your username>\AppData\LocalLow\Game-Ever Bt_\SquareLine_Studio\Player.log`
- **Linux:** `~/.config/unity3d/Game-Ever Bt_/SquareLine_Studio`
- **MacOS:** `~/Library/Logs/unity3d/Game-Ever Bt_/SquareLine_Studio/`

## Halts during exporting the files on MacOS

If you are using Mac M1 be sure to run SquareLine Studio with Rosetta as described [here](/docs/introduction/install#macos).

## Not starting or has high CPU usage on Windows

Try starting SquareLine Studio from command line as `SquareLine_Studio.exe -force-opengl`

## Texts are too small on a high DPI monitor

You can set the UI scale in the File -> Preferences menu.
